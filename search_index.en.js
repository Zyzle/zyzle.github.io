to get back into blogging for some time but have no idea what to write about to start me off, so why not write about choosing a blog tool and it's setup. We're going to go through some of the tools I've considered and the reasons behind my final choice as well as the process of creating a template and deploying the blog.\nWhy static site?\nFor a couple of reasons I've chosen to look at static site generators for this task. Firstly while I wan't to create, style, and release my content as simply as possible I want to be in control of it. With the blogging platforms available today I don't really find I get this. \nAnother big plus for me with the static site generators is I can keep all of the content in git in simple text files (usually markdown). The benefit if this to me is it allows my content to be stored in a version control system, I can look back through the history of drafts to see how things have progressed or even revert to older versions if I go off in a direction I later want to revise. \nI've always been a fan of reducing page bloat as much as possible, these days even simple articles are bogged down with so much unnecessary scripts, includes, and poorly optimised assets that page sizes are out of control. I chose at random a reasonably sized Medium blog post of around 1300 words, this clocked in at 4.4Mb! The actual readable text content of the page consisting of only 8Kb of this total, so yeah &lt;0.2%  of the page is actual content.\n\nMaciej Ceglowski has a great talk about this, the text of which can be found here\n\nFrom what I can see all of the most common blogging platforms these days share this issue with Medium and I don't really want to have to hand-crank every page of my blog from scratch so the obvious solution seems to be a static site generator.\nThese have become popular with content creators in recent years because they allow you to keep your content blog entries, pages, sections etc. in a set of simple markdown files which can then be processed by the engine into a set of pre-defined html templates creating a more complete looking web experience for the end user. \nThere are many of these tools available currently but we'll be focusing on 3 for the purposes of this blog, basically because I don't want to have to learn more than 3 tools and re-implementing the site more than that.\nThe three tools I've chosen to look at are:\nHugo\nOne of the most popular static site generators, more generic site template engine than the other two we'll be looking at. Claims to be one of the fastest static site generators around. Written in Go and uses Go's html/template and text/template libraries for its templating.\nJekyll\nOne of the older static site generators and the first (only?) one to be integrated into github pages. Built in Ruby and does appear to require some Ruby knowledge to use.\nZola\nThe newest of the three we'll be looking at written in Rust and using a custom template engine similar to Jinja. Has a strong opinion on how content should be structured but has good freedom in it's templates.\nThe plan is to implement the new blog, or at least a very small subset of it in each of these 3 tools  looking at things like: \n\nsimplicity of setup\nease of use\nflexibility\nbuild/deploy pipeline\n\nWhat I'm looking to achieve\nLooking to build a new home for the blog I thought up a few basic feature requirements:\n\nrequirements:\n\nease of adding blog entries\nlist by date published\npermalinking\nability to add custom template\nsyntax highlighting for code blocks\nstyled figures/quotes/callout sections\npage/deep links\n\n\nnice to have's:\n\nno bespoke markdown\nsimple site structure\ntaxonomies support\nability to draft entries\ntemplate that can be reused\nintegration with GH-pages deploy\n\n\n\nFor the first part of this series I'll create the same simple site template and basic page set in each of the three static site generators. I'm going to start with a simple homepage showing site title, a navigations section linking to homepage and an about page, a list of two blog entries showing title a summary of the page content and a link to continue reading. I'll also need another two templates, one for the free-form About page and one for our blog posts. \nThe basic sites first iteration should look something like the following:\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    The homepage\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    An about page\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    The blog list page sorted by date\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    A basic post page\n\nI'll also try and keep parity between the HTML generated by each \nBy the time you read this I'll have a decision made on which tool to use (spoiler it's Zola), in the coming posts I'll go through what I've found evaluation the 3 of these and hopefully my decision will become clear.\n","id":"https://zyzle.dev/blog/intro/","title":"Let's write a blog - Part 1: Intro"},"https://zyzle.dev/blog/jekyll/":{"body":"Jekyll is the oldest of the static site generators we'll be looking at it's 1.0 version appearing in 2013. It was originally designed to be centred around blogging but has grown into a more fully featured static site generator.\n\nThe application is written in ruby and the sites and themes are build around gems. One additional benefit of Jekyll is it comes fully supported by GitHub which will be my preferred way of hosting the blog for now.\nInstallation\nThis is where the first hurdles with Jekyll come in to play. For one thing apparently you shouldn't use the macOS system of Ruby for various reasons so we're going to first have to install the chruby tool. I'm going to skip the exact steps I went through for this but you can follow the instructions on the Jekyll site\n$ gem install bundler jekyll\n\nAs well as requiring a Ruby install Jekyll has quite a few gem dependencies making it one of the larger install footprints we'll be looking at.\nSite setup\nFirst we make a new directory for our blog and run the command\n$ bundle init\n\nThis gives us an empty Gemfile which we'll add our dependencies to:\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\n\ngem \"jekyll\"\n# this is required running ruby versions &gt;3\ngem \"webrick\"\n\n\nOnce these dependencies are in the gemfile we can use the bundle tool to install them with\n$ bundle\n\nNow we have our dependencies installed lets go ahead and create some basic directory structure for the site:\njekyllblog/\n  |-- _includes/\n  |-- _layouts/\n  |-- _posts/\n  |-- assets/\n  |-- _config.yml\n  +-- Gemfile\n\nThese directory names are fairly self explanatory, _includes will hold our template partials that can be included in other files, _layouts will contain our main template files, _posts will be where we put our blog page markdown files, and assets contains site assets.\nThe _config.yml is our Jekyll config file, we wont be adding much to this for the moment, just the sites title:\ntitle: My Blog\n\nNow we have the basics we can run Jekyll in watch mode to serve our site for us while we develop\n$ jekyll serve --watch\nConfiguration file: /Users/jekyllblog/_config.yml\n            Source: /Users/jekyllblog\n       Destination: /Users/jekyllblog/_site\n Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental\n      Generating...\n                    done in 0.02 seconds.\n Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/Users/jekyllblog'\n    Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000\n  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.\n\nIf we navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4000 right now all we'll see is the output directory listing from webrick so let's go ahead and add some templates and content.\nTemplating 101\nLet's go through the templates for our site. First the base template which we'll call default.html which we'll place in our _layouts its content will be as follows:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;{{page.title}} | {{ site.title }}&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;header&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;{{ site.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;\n      {% include navigation.html %}\n    &lt;/header&gt;\n    &lt;main&gt;{{ content }}&lt;/main&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nIf you read the previous entry in our series this base template should fairly familiar, Jekyll's templating engine Liquid (originally developed by Shopify) shares a lot of syntax with Tera.\nUnlike our Zola blog the Jekyll one does not define named content blocks the {{content}} template entry will automatically pick up the content either from a markdown page or from a sub-template that will extend this one. {{site.title}} simply comes from our _config.yml file.\nWe've separated our header navigation into an include in _includes/navigation.html\n&lt;nav&gt;\n  &lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{% link index.html %}\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{% link blog.html %}\"&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{% link about.md %}\"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/nav&gt;\n\nHere we use the Jekyll link command to construct a link to the specific pages in the root of the project, as we can see this link can either be to an explicit HTML file or a Markdown file that will be processed by Jekyll during its build.\nSo lets take a look at the index.html file that we've created:\n---\nlayout: default\ntitle: Home\n---\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the blog homepage&lt;/p&gt;\n\nNot much in the way of html in here, this is really just a front-matter telling Jekyll which layout template to plug this content in to and a title for the page.\nOur List/Entries pages\nOur blog.html file will contain a title and give us a basic unordered list of the current blog entries on the site. Jekyll gives us a helpful site.posts variable that we can iterate over for this purpose:\n---\nlayout: default\ntitle: Blog\n---\n\n&lt;h1&gt;List of blog posts&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  {% for post in site.posts %}\n  &lt;li&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"{{ post.url }}\"&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  {% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\nAgain we're using the default template here and injecting this content directly. So far so simple.\nThe blog entry page template blog-page.html contains the following:\n---\nlayout: default\n---\n\n&lt;h1 class=\"title\"&gt;\n\t{{page.title}}\n&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"subtitle\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;{{page.date}}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n{{ content }}\n\nAll we need to do here is pull out the page title and date from the page object Jekyll gives us and wrap these in some tags to be displayed at the top of the content block. Notice this templates front-matter where we have a layout property defined, this tells Jekyll to forward the results of merging this template with its markdown file into the content block of the default.html template defined above.\nThe final part of these blog posts is the markdown itself, these files are placed in the _posts folder and their names are prefixed by the post release date e.g 2022-05-20-post-1.md in these files we define a front-matter with template to use and title, then the content that makes up our blog post:\n---\nlayout: blog-page\ntitle: My first post\n---\n\nThis is the first blog post\n\nAbout Page\nThe about page we will be using exists as a markdown file at the root of the project about.md\n---\nlayout: page\ntitle: About\n---\n\nThis is the blog about page\n\nIt's template page.html  looks like this:\n---\nlayout: default\n---\n\n&lt;article&gt;\n  &lt;header&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;{{page.title}}&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;/header&gt;\n  {{ content }}\n&lt;/article&gt;\n\nAgain we have a partial HTML file with some basic tags that wrap the markdown content and extract the page title into a header. As with the previous template this is then passed up to the default.html template and inserted into it's content section.\nBuild and deploy\n$ jekyll build\nConfiguration file: /Users/jekyllblog/_config.yml\n            Source: /Users/jekyllblog\n       Destination: /Users/jekyllblog/_site\n Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental\n      Generating... \n                    done in 0.02 seconds.\n Auto-regeneration: disabled. Use --watch to enable.\n\nThe build process is quick and generates the static HTML into a directory in our blog root _site. The directory structure \n_site/\n  |-- 2002/\n  |    +-- 05/\n  |         |-- 06/\n  |         |    +-- post-1.html\n  |         +-- 07/\n  |              +-- post-2.html\n  |-- about.html\n  |-- blog.html\n  +-- index.html\n\nAs you can see Jekyll uses post dates to create a URL structure for the generated website, the compiled about page looks almost identical to our previous example\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\" /&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;About | My Blog&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;header&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;My Blog&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;nav&gt;\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/blog.html\"&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"/about.html\"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n      &lt;/nav&gt;\n    &lt;/header&gt;\n    &lt;main&gt;\n      &lt;article&gt;\n        &lt;header&gt;\n          &lt;h1&gt;About&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;/header&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;This is the blog about page&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/article&gt;\n    &lt;/main&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nUnlike our previous example Jekyll doesn't provide us with any extras out of the box although it does provide a wide catalogue of plugins that can be used with the site.\nConclusion\nJekyll is easy to get up and running with all be it if you have previous knowledge of managing a Ruby installation on your system, it's templating system is straightforward and the Liquid template engine is well documented. Jekyll's built URL structure is a little archaic and actually goes against what many SEO guides recommend. The constructed site is smaller than the one generated by Zola, mostly because of the omitted extra files like the 404 page and sitemap, and comes in at around 20Kb.\n","id":"https://zyzle.dev/blog/jekyll/","title":"Let's write a blog - Part 3: Jekyll"},"https://zyzle.dev/blog/markdown-test/":{"body":"This page is going to function as a test bed for the sites new styling, it's going to contain as many different markdown elements as possible in order to see whether or not we support them\nHeadings\nHeading 1\nHeading 2\nHeading 3\nHeading 4\nHeading 5\nHeading 6\nUnordered List\n\none\ntwo\nthree\n\nOrdered List\n\none\ntwo\nthree\n\nBlocks\n\nsome blockquote information text\nover multiple lines in markdown\n\n(() =&gt; {\n    const bar = document.querySelector('#progress-bar');\n    const post = document.querySelector('#docmain');\n    const html = document.documentElement;\n    const height = post.scrollHeight;\n\n    window.addEventListener('scroll', () =&gt; {\n        bar.style.width = \n            (html.scrollTop / (height - html.clientHeight))\n            * 100 + '%';\n    });\n})();\n\nText\nSome text with italic, bold, bold italic, monospaced, a link, strike\nImage\na basic image\n\none using our figure custom shortcode\n\n    \n    \n        \n    \n    \n    a caption for the image\n","id":"https://zyzle.dev/blog/markdown-test/","title":"Markdown Tester Page"},"https://zyzle.dev/blog/zola/":{"body":"Zola (formally Gutenberg) is a SSG written in Rust. Zola has it's own templating engine Tera created by the same author and follows a similar design in it's templating to Jinja 2. Distributed as a single binary Zola has a much smaller footprint than the other SSGs we'll be looking at, it also promises to be fast (comparable to Hugo) and runs from a simple augmented markdown including shortcodes and custom internal linking.\nInstallation\nZola comes as a single binary distributable, on MacOS the simplest way to install it is with homebrew.\n$ brew install zola\n\nZola is also available on MacPorts, Chocolatey, Scoop, and various linux package structures. With no external dependencies Zola is probably the simplest of the 3 tools we're looking at.\nThe version we'll be using is the current stable 0.15.3 (23rd Jan 2022) at the time of writing, with a total size of ~19mb it also has one of the smallest install footprints. \nSite setup\nZola has a simple setup wizard that runs through some basic configuration options\n$ zola init zolablog\n\nWizard process asks (defaults shown): \n* site url\n* Sass compilation (Y/n)\n* syntax highlighting (y/N)\n* search index (y/N)\n\ncreated site has following structure:\nzolablog/\n  |-- content/\n  |-- sass/\n  |-- static/\n  |-- templates/\n  |-- themes/\n  +-- config.toml\n\nA few empty directories and a config.toml with the minimal configuration I selected in the site setup wizard. The full list of Zola configuration options can be found in the zola documentation. The config will looks something like the following:\n# The URL the site will be built for\nbase_url = \"https://example.com\"\n\ntitle = \"My Blog\"\n\n# Whether to automatically compile all Sass files in the sass directory\ncompile_sass = true\n\n# Whether to build a search index to be used later on by a JavaScript library\nbuild_search_index = false\n\n[markdown]\n# Whether to do syntax highlighting\n# Theme can be customised by setting the `highlight_theme` variable to a theme supported by Zola\nhighlight_code = true\n\n[extra]\n# Put all your custom variables here\n\nLet's start the development server with the following\n$ zola serve\nBuilding site...\nChecking all internal links with anchors.\n&gt; Successfully checked 0 internal link(s) with anchors.\n-&gt; Creating 0 pages (0 orphan), 0 sections, and processing 0 images\nDone in 56ms.\n\nWeb server is available at http://127.0.0.1:1111\n\nListening for changes in /Users/zolablog{/Users/zolablog/config.toml, content, sass, static, templates}\nPress Ctrl+C to stop\n\nZola automatically runs in watch mode so any changes you make will be built and served.\nTemplating 101\nI'm not going to work off of a base template for Zola as everything can be built simply from scratch.\nWe'll start with a base.html file that all our other templates will inherit from:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;{% block title %}{{ config.title }}{% endblock title %}&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;header&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;{{ config.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;\n        {% include \"navigation.html\" %}\n    &lt;/header&gt;\n    &lt;main&gt;\n      {% block content %}{% endblock %}\n    &lt;/main&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nThis is a fairly standard html5 template using some semantic html tags. Tera has 3 types of expression delimiters:\n\n{{ and }} for expressions\n{% and %} for statements\n{# and #} for comments\n\nIn the above we pick out the site title from the configuration file with config.title and wrap this with a title named block which we can override later. We also define a block called content inside the sites &lt;main&gt; tags that we'll be substituting with out page content in later templates. For now lets have a look at the navigation.html template that will be included in the the header tag.\n&lt;nav&gt;\n  &lt;ul&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{ get_url(path=\"@/_index.md\") }}\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{ get_url(path=\"@/blog/_index.md\") }}\"&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{ get_url(path=\"@/about.md\") }}\"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/nav&gt;\n\nThe get_url function gives the permalink for a given path the @/ will be treated as an internal link to the root of the Zola content directory. Lets have a look at the first entry here, the _index.md\n+++\npage_template = \"page.html\"\n+++\n\nThis simple markdown frontmatter does is tell zola that any pages contained in this directory should be rendered with the page.html template, we'll come back to the contents of this later. \nZola will also render the index.html file found in the templates directory at the site root\n{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n\n{% block title %}Home | {{ super() }}{% endblock title %}\n\n{% block content %}\n&lt;p&gt;This is the blog homepage&lt;/p&gt;\n{% endblock content %}\n\nHere we are again extending the sites base.html and overriding the named blocks, first our title block, this has the interesting super() method which places the blocks existing content defined in the base template at the calling location allowing us to keep the sites name without having to redefine it in every template.\nWe just add a simple static paragraph of text into the content block of the template.\nPages\nZola considers directories inside the content directory as sections, we'll create a new dir and file /blog/_index.md and add some toml frontmatter that will tell Zola how to render this sections root page and any sub-pages:\n+++\ntitle = \"List of blog posts\"\nsort_by = \"date\"\ntemplate = \"blog.html\"\npage_template = \"blog-page.html\"\n+++\n\nThis tells Zola, render the blog/ index url using the blog.html template and apply the blog-page.html template to any markdown files in this section folder, the sort_by directive also tells Zola to sort the articles in this section by date, default newest first. \nBlog list\nLets look at the index page template blog.html first:\n{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n\n{% block title %}{{ section.title }} | {{ super() }}{% endblock title %}\n\n{% block content %}\n&lt;h1 class=\"title\"&gt;\n  {{ section.title }}\n&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  {% for page in section.pages %}\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"{{ page.permalink | safe }}\"&gt;{{ page.title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n  {% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n{% endblock content %}\n\nAs we've seen before we start by extending the base.html template and override the title section using super again to keep our site title, then we insert into our content block. We use section.title to pull out the title we defined in the front matter in _index.md.\nNow we get on to showing the blog list. Zola offers us the section.pages variable that gives us a sorted list of page objects representing pages in our section that we can iterate over and provide links to using their permalink and title variables.\nBlog Page\n{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n\n{% block content %}\n&lt;h1 class=\"title\"&gt;\n\t{{ page.title }}\n&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p class=\"subtitle\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;{{ page.date }}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n{{ page.content | safe }}\n{% endblock content %}\n\nThere's not much in this template, again we're extending the base.html file and inserting our content into the named block. We'll also apply the Zola safe filter to the content because no html escaping is required for the content generated from the markdown by Zola.\nAbout\nOur final template is the top level page.html we use to render the about.md about page content.\n{% extends \"base.html\" %}\n\n{% block title%}{{ page.title }} | {{ super() }}{% endblock title %}\n\n{% block content %}\n&lt;article&gt;\n  &lt;header&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;{{ page.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;/header&gt;\n  {{ page.content | safe }}\n&lt;/article&gt;\n{% endblock content %}\n\nThere's nothing here we haven't looked at already, it's just a cut down version of the blog page template.\nBuilding for deployment\n$ zola build\nBuilding site...\nChecking all internal links with anchors.\n&gt; Successfully checked 0 internal link(s) with anchors.\n-&gt; Creating 3 pages (0 orphan) and 1 sections\nDone in 13ms.\n\nThe build process is simple and fast, by default outputs the site to the public directory. The output looks like the following:\npublic/\n  |-- about/\n  |    +-- index.html\n  |-- blog/\n  |    |-- first/\n  |    |    +-- index.html\n  |    |-- second/\n  |    |    +-- index.html\n  |    +-- index.html\n  |-- 404.html\n  |-- index.html\n  |-- robots.txt\n  +-- sitemap.xml\n\nSo our pages have been placed into individual HTML files using the templates we defined in the previous steps as an example here's what the about page looks like compiled:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;About | My Blog&lt;/title&gt;\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;header&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;My Blog&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;nav&gt;\n        &lt;ul&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://example.com/\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://example.com/blog/\"&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n          &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://example.com/about/\"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n      &lt;/nav&gt;\n    &lt;/header&gt;\n    &lt;main&gt;\n      &lt;article&gt;\n        &lt;header&gt;\n          &lt;h1&gt;About&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;/header&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;This is the blog about page&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/article&gt;\n    &lt;/main&gt;\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nWe haven't defined a template for a 404 page so Zola generates us a default one:\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;404 Not Found&lt;/h1&gt;\n\nThere's also a basic robots.txt which points to our auto-generated sitemap.xml and if we had chosen it when we did the setup wizard we would have a JS search index file as well as a copy of Elasticlunr that can be hooked up to provide search functionality to our site. These are all extra features generated that I may take a deeper dive into later on but for now we're done with the basic setup.\nConclusion\nZola was easy to get up and running with, the templating engine is simple and seems well documented. Zola provides a lot of good integrations for more advanced features such as search and site feeds we'll look at in later sections.
